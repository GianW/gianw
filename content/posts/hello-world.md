This site was made for this purposes:

- **To document my projects and studies;**
- **Quick reference to myself;**
- **Improve communication skills.**

**To document my projects and studies:** To document the process of creation and the design decisions around the projects i've worked with, and to take as a notebook for my studies.

**Quick reference to myself:** The [Brain](https://gianw.github.io/brain) is a place where i'm going to put my code snippets and my technologies guides.

**Improve communication skills:** Communication is a fundamental skill, as a developer i need to regulate myself to be constantly improving this skill, other challenge is make my content in english.

That's all.

Be welcome!
