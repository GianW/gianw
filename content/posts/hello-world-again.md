Some years ago i've built a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) version of this site, to learn and write about the things i'm studing, after a while i've rebuild it using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) i wrote more about this [here](https://www.gianw.com/posts/hello-world).

In 2020 i started to learn about [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and all stuff about SSR, Serverless functions and etc, also i would like to get my data from diferent sources and make it all work together.

Theres any better place than my digital lab? That's why i made again this website, to try different resources, use matrial UI with Next and test many things.

I know theres a lot of inproviments i need to do here, but i'm really enjoing to use Next.

See you!
